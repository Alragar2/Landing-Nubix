# Nubix Landing Page - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a modern React TypeScript landing page for Nubix, a technology company specializing in digital transformation solutions. The project uses Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Code Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript for all React components
- Follow functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling - avoid custom CSS when possible
- Maintain responsive design principles (mobile-first approach)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep components modular and reusable

## Component Structure
- All components are in `/src/components/`
- Each component should be in its own file
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic elements)

## Design System
- Primary colors: Use the `primary` color palette defined in tailwind.config.js
- Secondary colors: Use the `secondary` color palette for neutral elements
- Typography: Inter font family is used throughout the project
- Spacing: Use Tailwind's spacing system consistently
- Components should have hover states and smooth transitions

## Best Practices
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper accessibility
- Optimize images and use appropriate alt texts
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use proper form validation and error handling
- Keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Comment complex logic when necessary
